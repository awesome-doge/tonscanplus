# TonscanPlus for Firefox

A powerful browser extension for The Open Network (TON) blockchain explorer, bringing enhanced functionality to tonscan.org. While tonscan.org is widely used for its clean interface, we've added a crucial missing feature - a personal address book.

## Features

- Add custom names to TON addresses locally
- Filter transactions by type
- Community-driven address database
- Seamless integration with tonscan.org

## Current Limitations

- TOP 1000 addresses are not updated in real-time
- NFT Royalty addresses are manually parsed

## Installation

The extension is available on Firefox Add-ons:

[Install TonscanPlus](https://github.com/awesome-doge/tonscanplus/releases)
